MMIO Write/Read access dumper
      
This library will intercept mmap call (libc) and check if the process
is trying to mmap the address you provide in environement variable SF_ADDR.
If it intercept such a call it will mmap and protect the area against
read/write.

In the meantime a signal handler for SIGSEGV is installed. Thus any attempt
to read or write the mapped and protected area will call the signal handler.
The signal handler then disassemble the instruction responsible for the
segmentation fault and try to emulate instruction (WARNING supporting only
mov right now other instruction might blow up the universe). And log the
operation in file (SF_LOGFILE environnement variable or stderr).

If it detects unsupported instruction i will unprotect the area and resume
the program execution but this may fail (and will according to murphy law).

WARNING this are highly experimental and should be use with care.
Thus run sync three times to honour coders of old ;).

As a side note just use stderr if you want to log things with Xorg, or
you will get a corrupted log.
